# Assignment: Getting Comfortable with NPM

## Part 1: Initialize a Project

1. Create a new NPM package.
    1. Name your package `1-tools-assignment`
    2. Use `jest` as the test command
    3. Set the git repository to the repository for this assignment
    4. Give it an `assignment` keyword
    5. Set the `author` to your First and Last Name 
    6. Use the defaults for everything else
2. Install `jest` as a devDependency.

## Part 2: Setup a Development Environment

Most JavaScript Frameworks need to be setup using various tools and configurations in order to run correctly in a browser. Each framework will have a Getting Started guide in their Documentation that explains how to set up your development environment. Since we will be using the Material Design Components (MDC) for the Web throughout the semester, you will need to complete the Getting Started guide on their website. 

MDC uses a fairly common workflow. It uses the Sass CSS preprocessor to make working with CSS easier. It uses Autoprefixer to automatically add vendor prefixes to CSS properties. It uses Babel to transpile the newer ES2015+ JavaScript features into a version that is better supported by most browsers. And it uses Webpack to combine all of them to output one `bundle.js` file and one `bundle.css` file.
